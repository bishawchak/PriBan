Scaling Assessment (1–5):

1 = Very unnatural → Empty, broken, or incoherent sentences. Missing structure.

2 = Mostly unnatural → Very short fragments or incomplete clauses; lacks fluency.

3 = Somewhat natural → Understandable but awkward; missing verb, punctuation, or overly repetitive.

4 = Mostly natural → Grammatical and fluent, but with minor issues (slightly vague, too short/long, or fragment-like).

5 = Very natural → Fully fluent, coherent, and typical in everyday Bangla usage.
